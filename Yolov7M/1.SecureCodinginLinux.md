## Info
1. Backup tools
- cp

      cp /path/to/example.txt /path/to/backup/directory

- Deja Dup (backup utility)
- backup software
rsync, Back In Time, and Duplicity.
- automated backups
  
      rsync -av /path/to/source /path/to/destination
      cron ..

(backups have to be done in safe location)

2. Update
- update package list and upgrade installed packages

      sudo apt update    # update local packages list 
      sudo apt upgrade    # upgrade to latest versions
      sudo apt dist-upgrade   # install new dependencies and removes obsolete packages, aggressive upgrade
      sudo apt-get install linux-generic   # installs latest generic linux kernel available on Ubuntu 18.04

cleaning up 

    sudo apt autoremove  # removes packages automatically installed and no longer required


4. Firewall
- configuring firewall settings and implementing security measures like fail2ban

check ufw status, enale 

    sudo ufw status verbose  # verify current status of firewall, 
    sudo ufw enable  # enabling it
    sudo ufw allow 22/tcp   # <port_number>/tcp, allow specific services or ports (ssh, HTTP, https)

deny incoming, outgoing traffic

    sudo ufw default deny incoming  # could be customized
    sudo ufw default allow outgoing
    sudo ufw logging on    # enable logging, to log ufw actions for later review
    sudo ufw reload    # after making changes, reload ufw to apply new rules

installing and configuring fail2ban

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install fail2ban   # main configuration file is usually located '/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf'
    sudo systemctl start fail2ban
    sudo systemctl enable fail2ban

Regularly review logs (/var/log/ufw.log, /var/log/fail2ban.log, etc.) for any suspicious activities.

5. Code  Editor Safety
Verifying the source of code or scripts you plan to execute is crucial for maintaining system security. Here are some practices and tips to ensure the safety of code before execution:
- trusted sources
- digital certification, hashes - Some software packages, especially those distributed by official sources, provide digital signatures or hashes that you can use to verify the authenticity and integrity of the code. Verify these signatures or hashes against the ones provided by the software developer.
- inspect code - Look for any suspicious or malicious-looking code snippets. Reviewing code can help identify potential security risks.
- sandboxing, virtual env - Consider running untrusted code in a sandboxed environment or within a virtual machine. This method isolates the code execution from your main system, limiting potential damage in case the code is malicious.
- check dependencies, permissions - Review the dependencies required by the code or script. Ensure that the permissions it requests are reasonable and necessary.
- scan with antivirus
- community feedback and review
- keep software updated
- version control - For projects involving multiple contributors, use version control systems (such as Git) to track changes and easily identify potential malicious modifications.
- Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common security practices and vulnerabilities. Understanding security risks better equips you to identify potential threats in code or scripts.

6. FileHandling
- handling line endings properly when working with files between Windows and Ubuntu is crucial to avoid compatibility issues. Here are steps to check and maintain consistent line endings:

Ubuntu/linux:

    file <filename>   # Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable, commonly used in Unix/Linux systems for scripting purposes.
    cat -A <filename>   "$" at the end of lines using cat -A, it means the file is using Unix-style line endings (LF).
The cat -A command shows non-printing characters, making line endings visible as ^M for Windows (CRLF) line endings.

Windows:
Text editors like Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text often display line ending types. In Notepad++, go to "View" > "Show Symbol" > "Show End of Line" to display line endings.

- maintaining consistent line endings in 

Ubuntu:
using dos2unix
converts windows crlf line endings to unix lf line endings

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install dos2unix  
    dos2unix <filename>
    sed -i 's/\r$//' <filename>

Windows:
using unix2dos
If needed, convert Unix/Linux (LF) line endings to Windows (CRLF) line endings using the unix2dos command. This might be necessary when transferring files from Ubuntu to Windows.
    
    unix2dos <filename>

usings text editors
Most advanced text editors like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code offer options to change line endings. In Notepad++, it's under "Edit" > "EOL Conversion."

CRLF stands for Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF). It's represented as "\r\n".
Carriage Return (\r) signifies moving the cursor to the beginning of the line.
Line Feed (\n) denotes moving the cursor down to the next line.
LF stands for Line Feed. It's represented as "\n". It signifies moving the cursor down to the next line.

Windows: Typically uses CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) as the line ending format in text files.
Unix/Linux: Uses LF (Line Feed) as the line ending format in text files.
macOS (pre-OS X): Historically used CR (Carriage Return) as the line ending format, but later versions, including macOS based on Unix, use LF.


7. Regular user

- Suppose you're working solely with the root account on your Ubuntu system and wish to create a new regular user account to follow the best practice of not using the root account for everyday tasks. In that case, you can do so by following these steps:

Ubuntu:
adduser command creates new user

    adduser <username>  #You'll be prompted to set a password and fill in additional information about the new user.

add user to sudo group

    usermod -aG sudo <username>  # This command adds the user to the sudo group, allowing them to use the sudo command to perform administrative tasks.

- switching to user

exit root session, to log out root
log in as new user

    su - <username>
    su <username>   #You'll be prompted to enter the password for the new user.
    su   ## switchback to root
